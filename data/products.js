  export default products;
// This code defines a list of products with their details such as id, name, price, image, and description.
// It exports the products array so it can be used in other parts of the application, such as in a products page or component.
// The products can be displayed in a grid layout, with each product showing its name, price, and an image.
// This structure allows for easy expansion by adding more products to the array as needed.
// The products can be used in a Next.js application, where they can be rendered dynamically on a products page.
// The products array can be imported into components or pages to display product listings, details, or in a shopping cart.
// The products can be styled using CSS or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing layout.
// The products array can be extended with more fields like category, stock status, or ratings to enhance functionality.
// This code is a simple representation of product data that can be used in an e-commerce application.
// The products array can be fetched from an API or a database in a real-world application, but here it is hardcoded for simplicity.
// The products can be used in conjunction with a shopping cart system, allowing users to add items to their cart and proceed to checkout.
